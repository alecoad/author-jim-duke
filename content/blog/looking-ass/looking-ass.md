<div class="poem">

"Why do you keep such ugly beasts",  
it's often asked of me.  
"Why not have one horse at least,  
so beautiful, wild, and free."

It seems so plain, so obvious,  
how could I feel ill-fated?  
To surround myself with the very best  
that ever were created.

A friendship now days known by few,  
the very best companions.  
Contented just to pack us through  
the mountains, plains, and canyons.

It seems forever, more or less,  
he's shouldered mankind's loads  
And brought us through the wilderness  
with little use for roads.

And while I'm no religious man,  
it must show good behavior  
To be chosen as delivery van  
and guardian of the savior.

He provides us with solutions  
for problems yet uncounted,  
But his greatest contributions  
are not when he is mounted.

When you gaze upon a grazing jack,  
you may see a lowly ass.  
You can be sure he's looking back  
'neath the guise of nibbling grass.

He wears the perfect poker face,  
he is what you impose.  
But while you stand there, heels in place,  
he's always on his toes.

Unknowing eyes will think they feast  
upon a silly creature.  
A simple, strange, and awkward beast  
without redeeming feature.

Those that are demanding  
will find his every fault  
And take each patient standing  
as a personal assault.

If then they try to use some force  
and find he can't be budged,  
Heâ€™s judged the wrong end of a horse,  
themselves correctly judged.

But patient, understanding eyes  
might find a lifelong friend  
One to trust when hard times rise,  
one to count on to the end.

So, if you see a lowly ass,  
then that's just what he'll be  
When viewing nature's looking glass,  
you are just what you see.
